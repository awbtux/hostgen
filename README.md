## To-do
- [ ] -n/--names: read a list of names from a file at runtime, or from stdin if '-' is passed
- [ ] when -P and -s are set, attempt to substitute the old hostname with the new one in a file, instead of overwriting the whole file
- [ ] make an actual build system (other than `$ cc main.c -o hostgen`)
- [ ] write readme
- [ ] add hostname templates
